# coCoder

Welcome to coCoder! This is a tool that you might use for collaborative coding, rapid prototyping or whatever other use case that require you to use a shared, easy to access text editor. This project is currently hosted at http://cocoder.org.

## How do I use it?

It's very simple! All you need to do is click a big `Start new session` button on the welcome screen and share the obtained link with your friend. The editor supports all modern browsers, so you won't have to install anything to make it work. Every session is being stored for the full week from last activity on it, so please, don't use this project as a long term storage of your work.

## Is there a dark mode?

Of course! At the moment there are two color themes available at the moment. Please, feel free to pick your favorite!
