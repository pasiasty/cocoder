<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when websites
    are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit
    (through a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or for multiple repeat visits (using a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).</p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire
    when you close the web browser.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or mobile
    device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and efficient experience
    for you while visiting the Website and Services.</p>
<p>Cookies may be set by the Website (&quot;first-party cookies&quot;), or by third parties, such as those who serve
    content or provide advertising or analytics services on the Website (&quot;third party cookies&quot;). These third
    parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites. You may learn
    more about cookies and how they work in this <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" routerLink="/"

<h3>Analytical cookies</h3>
<p>These cookies enable us and third party services to collect aggregated data for statistical purposes on how our
    visitors use the Website. These cookies do not contain personal information such as names and email addresses and
    are used to help us improve your user experience of the Website.</p>
<h3>Advertising cookies</h3>
<p>Advertising cookies allow us and third parties serve relevant ads to you more effectively and help us collect
    aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers. They also enable us to understand and
    improve the delivery of ads to you and know when certain ads have been shown to you.</p>
<p>Your web browser may request advertisements directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set
    their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.</p>
<p>Although we do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third party websites, we do use
    aggregate data from third parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising. We do not provide any personal
    information that we collect to advertisers.</p>
<h2>Do we use web beacons or tracking pixels?</h2>
<p>Our emails may contain a &quot;web beacon&quot; (or &quot;tracking pixel&quot;) to tell us whether our emails are
    opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email.</p>
<p>We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users and
    to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.</p>
<p>The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device,
    you should read the email in plain text view or with images disabled.</p>
